Description: You can apply image processing effects that modifies the perceived material properties of objects
    in photos, such as gloss, smoothness, and blemishes. This is an implementation of the algorithm proposed by
    Boyadzhiev et al. (2015) "Band-Sifting Decomposition for Image Based Material Editing".
    Documentation and practical tips of the package is available at <https://github.com/tsuda16k/materialmodifier>.
